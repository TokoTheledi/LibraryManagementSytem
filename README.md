# LibraryManagementSytem

This code is for a simple library management system written in Java. Let's break it down step by step:

Import Statements:
import java.util.*;: This imports all classes in the java.util package, which includes the Scanner class used for input.
Main Class (LMSystem):
It has two private fields: books and members, which are lists of Book and Member objects respectively.
The main method creates an instance of LMSystem and calls its run method.
The run method creates a Scanner object to take user input and enters a loop displaying a menu and prompting the user for a choice.
Depending on the user's choice, it calls different methods like addBook, searchBooks, etc.
Menu Method (Menu()):
Prints out the options available in the library management system.
getUserChoice Method:
Prompts the user to enter a choice and returns the integer entered.
addBook Method:
Prompts the user to enter details of a book (title, author, ISBN), creates a new Book object with the provided details, and adds it to the books list.
searchBooks Method:
Prompts the user to enter a search term, iterates through the list of books, and prints out books whose title or author matches the search term.
registerMember Method:
Prompts the user to enter details of a member (name, email), creates a new Member object with the provided details, and adds it to the members list.
checkoutOrReturnBook Method:
Prompts the user to enter the member's name and the book's title.
If the member or book is not found, it prints an appropriate message.
If found, it calls checkoutBook or returnBook method of the Member class based on whether it's a checkout or return action.
findMemberByName and findBookByTitle Methods:
These methods search for a member or a book by name or title respectively in their respective lists.
Inner Classes (Book and Member):
These are nested classes within the LMSystem class.
Book class represents a book with fields like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
Member class represents a library member with fields like name, email, and a list of borrowed books.
Both classes have methods to perform actions like checking out and returning books.
